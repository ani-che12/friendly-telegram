<h2> Fall is the best season of the year. </h2>
<p> Fall season may just be the best season of the year. As the days grow shorter,
there is a change in the air, from the sweltering heat, the weather begins to cool.
The trees become colorful and a relaxing breeze passes by.</p>
<p> There are a few reasons fall is my favorite.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can wear comfy sweaters and listen to calm music.</li>
<li>Apple cider and hot chocolate is extremely nice to drink then.</li>
<li>As the school year begins, it seems there so many possibilities.</li>
</ul>
